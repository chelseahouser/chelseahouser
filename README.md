# What am I up to?

- Working on an application to automate importing ![Swagger](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Swagger-%23Clojure?style=for-the-badge&logo=swagger&logoColor=white) documentation into ![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF6C37?style=for-the-badge&logo=postman&logoColor=white). This will allow me to build a fully automated pipeline that will start from making a change in a controller action and building the swagger documentation, to then import that swagger documentation into postman and build integration tests within postman that can then be scheduled to run periodically. This application is written in ![NestJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nestjs-%23E0234E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=nestjs&logoColor=white).
- Starting a deep-dive into ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/angular-%23DD0031.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white) to fill in holes in my knowledge with the help of ![Udemy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udemy-A435F0?style=for-the-badge&logo=Udemy&logoColor=white).

      <p>This application will take in a swagger url and create/update a postman collection based on the API definition. From there, this application will build up some basic integration tests for automated pipelines.</p>

      <p>Yes, another library app. This application is a simple NestJS API that I use to build up a catalog of all my books. With this API I can track where my books are, what notes or reviews I have of them, and import them into my website to publish what I am reading.</p>
