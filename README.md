<h1>What am i up to?</h1>

- Working on an application to automate importing ![Swagger](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Swagger-%23Clojure?style=for-the-badge&logo=swagger&logoColor=white) documentation into ![Postman](https://img.shields.io/badge/Postman-FF6C37?style=for-the-badge&logo=postman&logoColor=white). This will allow me to build a fully automated pipeline from making a change in a controller action -> building the swagger documentation -> importing that swagger documentation into postman -> building integration tests within postman -> schedule the integration tests to run periodically.
- Learning Devops in ![Google Cloud](https://img.shields.io/badge/GoogleCloud-%234285F4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-cloud&logoColor=white). My current client is a heavy user of GCP and improving my knowledge of the structure will allow me to work more efficiently to help my client out. I hope to use my skills to improve the
- Refreshing my knowledge of ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/c++-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) with the help of ![Codecademy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Codecademy-FFF0E5?style=for-the-badge&logo=codecademy&logoColor=1F243A). Regular practice of languages I have not used in a while, yet are still used at potential clients ensures my skills are always ready to jump to where I am needed the most.
